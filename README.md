# PHP Coding Exam â€“ Precision Data Solutions (PDS)

Good day!

I have completed the **PDS IT Coding Exam** as instructed from [this repository](https://github.com/pdsc-ph/php-coding-challenge). The program includes:

- A **PHP command-line application**: `process-logs.php` that processes the `sample-log.txt` file.
- Generates an `output.txt` file based on the given specifications.
- All **field formatting** and **sorting logic** have been fully implemented according to the instructions provided.

Please feel free to review the submission.

Let me know if any additional information or clarification is needed.

Thank you for the opportunity, and I look forward to the next steps in the process.

Best regards,  
**Escondo, Aaron Vincent**
